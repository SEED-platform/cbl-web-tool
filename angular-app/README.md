# CBL Web Tool UI

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Linting

Run `npm run lint` or `npm run lint:fix` to check for eslint, prettier, and stylelint errors (and optionally fix them)

## Analyzing the Webpack Bundle

Run `npm run build:stats` and drop the `dist/stats.json` file onto the site https://esbuild.github.io/analyze/
