# Python Notebooks

This directory contains python notebooks for non-critical tasks for this project. They may be useful for people developing this project but not necessarily for CBL users.

Do not use the flask-app/myenv virtual environment to run these notebooks. Create a different virtual environment using the `requirements-notebooks.txt` file.
